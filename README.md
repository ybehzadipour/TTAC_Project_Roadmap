# Hi there, I'm Yasaman Behzadipour 👋
**Pharm.D. | Supply Chain Manager | Clinical Data Scientist**

I bridge the gap between **Clinical Pharmacy**, **Logistics**, and **Data Science**. My goal is to design resilient, AI-driven Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) for resource-constrained environments.

## 🔭 The Long-Term Vision: The "Connect-Care" Ecosystem
*My proposed framework for a Multimorbidity Learning Health System (Aligned with DynAIRx goals).*

Current healthcare systems operate in silos. I am working toward a closed-loop, AI-driven ecosystem that integrates physicians, pharmacists, patients, and supply chains into a single **Learning Health System**.

### 1. 🩺 The Physician (Intelligent Prescribing)
*Moving beyond static alerts to Context-Aware CDSS.*
- **Cross-Provider Safety:** An AI layer that scans patient history across different specialists to detect "Prescribing Cascades" (e.g., treating an adverse effect of Drug A with Drug B).
- **Renal/Hepatic Guardrails:** Dynamic alerts that flag dosage adjustments based on real-time lab values (e.g., eGFR) specific to the patient's comorbidity profile.
- **Supply-Chain Aware Prescribing:** Preventing non-adherence by suggesting clinically equivalent, *in-stock* alternatives during national shortages.

### 2. 💊 The Pharmacist (The Safety Gatekeeper)
*Optimization at the point of dispensing.*
- **Regimen Consolidation (Smart Clustering):** An AI algorithm that minimizes dosing frequency to boost adherence. It analyzes the interaction matrix of all 10+ medications to scientifically "lump" them into the fewest possible intake windows (e.g., just Morning & Night).
- **Context-Aware Grouping:** Automatically sorting new drugs into existing "lumps" based on bioavailability rules (e.g., "Requires Acidic Environment" vs. "Empty Stomach") so patients never have to memorize complex rules.
- **OTC Integration:** Logging Over-The-Counter interactions to prevent silent risks (e.g., NSAIDs + Warfarin).

### 3. 👤 The Patient (Empowerment)
*Health Literacy & Real-World Evidence.*
- **Longitudinal Symptom Trajectories:** Visualizing "Response to Therapy" by mapping patient-reported symptoms against medication changes over time.
- **Interactive Pharmacovigilance:** Automated follow-ups on reported side effects (e.g., "Is your headache better after 24h?") to triage adverse events.

## ⚡ Active Research: Iran Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Intelligence
*While my vision is broad, my current active research focuses on **Governance & Policy** using national TTAC data.*

> **Project Status:** 🟢 Active | **Phase:** Research & Roadmap
> **Domain:** Healthcare Supply Chain, Crisis Management, Pharmacoeconomics

### The Research Roadmap
I am currently analyzing **12 critical questions** regarding the resilience of the Iranian pharmaceutical market:

#### 🏛️ Pillar 1: The Crisis Response Engine (Operational Efficiency)
* **The "Rescue Lag":** Quantifying the time delta between shortage detection and emergency import arrival.
* **The "Waste Metric":** Comparing Supplier vs. Distributor data to measure dead stock.
* **Band-Aid vs. Cure:** Survival analysis on emergency imports—do they fix the market, or create a shortage cycle?

#### 🧠 Pillar 2: Market Dynamics & Behavioral Science
* **Substitution Analysis:** Do shortages of a specific drug trigger a statistically significant switch to functional substitutes? (See *Warfarin Case Study*).
* **The "Stickiness" Factor:** Do prescribers switch back when the original drug returns, or is market share permanently lost?
* **Cannibalization Rates:** Measuring the adoption lag of new Fixed-Dose Combinations (FDCs) vs. single-agent drugs.

#### 🛡️ Pillar 3: Strategic Stockpiling (Prediction)
* **The "High-Risk" Watchlist:** Developing a Risk Score for generic codes based on shortage frequency to guide national stockpiling.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Using sales velocity + inventory levels to predict stockouts 3 months in advance.
